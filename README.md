# Real-Time Traffic Sign Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks  

This project implements a real-time traffic sign recognition system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The system is capable of recognizing various traffic signs and can be utilized in autonomous vehicles, driver assistance systems, or any other applications involving traffic sign detection.  

---

## Overview  

This project consists of:  
1. A **training pipeline** to build and train a CNN for traffic sign classification.  
2. A **real-time testing system** that uses the trained model to recognize traffic signs from live webcam input.  

The model classifies traffic signs into predefined categories based on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark dataset or any user-defined dataset.  

---

## Features  

- **Data Preprocessing**:  
  - Grayscale conversion, histogram equalization, and normalization.  
- **Data Augmentation**:  
  - Random transformations (rotation, zoom, translation) to enhance model robustness.  
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**:  
  - Deep learning architecture trained for multi-class classification.  
- **Real-Time Recognition**:  
  - Uses a live video feed to detect and classify traffic signs.  

---

## Dataset  

The project uses a dataset of labeled images of traffic signs. It is structured into subdirectories, each representing a specific traffic sign class.  

- Ensure your dataset is structured as follows:  
  ```
  myData/
      ├── 0/
      ├── 1/
      ├── ...
      └── N/
  ```
- Labels for the classes are defined in `labels.csv`.  

---

## Preprocessing  

The preprocessing steps include:  
1. **Resizing** images to 32x32 pixels.  
2. **Converting to grayscale** for simplicity.  
3. **Equalizing histogram** to standardize image lighting conditions.  
4. **Normalization** to scale pixel values between 0 and 1.  

These steps are implemented in the `preprocessing` function.  

---

## Model Architecture  

The CNN model architecture consists of:  
- **Convolutional Layers**: Extract spatial features using filters of size 5x5 and 3x3.  
- **Max Pooling**: Downsample feature maps for better generalization.  
- **Dropout Layers**: Reduce overfitting by randomly disabling neurons.  
- **Dense (Fully Connected) Layers**: Perform classification with a softmax activation function.

## How to Use  

### Training  

1. **Prepare Dataset**: Place your dataset in the `myData` folder and label classes in `labels.csv`.  
2. **Train the Model**: Run the training code to preprocess data, augment images, and train the CNN.  
   ```bash  
   python train.py  
   ```  
3. **Save the Model**: The trained model will be saved as `model_trained`.  

### Testing  

1. **Load the Trained Model**: Use the `model_trained` file for predictions.  
2. **Run Real-Time Recognition**: Execute the testing script to start the webcam feed.  
   ```bash  
   python test.py  
   ```  

Press `q` to exit the webcam feed.
